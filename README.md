# Old trick, new tools and technologies
Back in 1953, a French astronomer, André Hamon, described a mechanism to correct error of tangent drives in an article of the «Société d'Astronomie Française» Bulletin.
The article, written in the perspective of building the device, precisely described how the profile of cams could be drafted on a transparent plexiglas sheet using a ruler and compasses. A full scan in PDF format can be found here: http://www.astrosurf.com/astroptics/files/hamon_1953.pdf
A translation to this solution where published in «Sky & Telescope» June 1978

Today, the digital incarnation of the drawing board is a CAD software, and with a bit of adaptation, the same constructs can be done on screen. Then the most advanced tools also include a CAM integration to drive digital manufacturing of the designs.
This is the purpose of this project, its goal is to bring back an old trick to the attention of amateur astronomer or photographers who want to practice astrophotography with very long shutter time, ideally the «Bulb» mode.

# Observing the sky
Imagine the picture of the stars in the sky were printed inside an umbrella. We open the umbrella and point it in direction of Polaris, the northern star, and slowly rotate the handle in the counter clockwise direction to keep up with the sky rotation in 1440 minutes every day, letting some stars disappear behind the horizon on the left (west) and other ones appear on the right (east). This is that movement that astronomers of photographers need to reproduce.

# Other well known solutions
There is another family of such devices called «Barn Door Tracker» or «Haig arm»

# Specific features of this solution
This solution is relying on cams to correct error between constant angular speed and constant linear speed along a tangent to an apparently circular path followed by stars and planet.
The driving screw used does not support the full weight of the camera, and of the arm itself. It can be small.
The camera is safely attached to the device with an M8 screw.
A type 608 ballbearing is used to allow minimal rotation resistance.
